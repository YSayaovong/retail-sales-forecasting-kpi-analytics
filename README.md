## 📚 Case Study: Identifying Underperforming Rentals & Improving Portfolio ROI

### ✅ Scenario
A small real estate investor manages four rental properties using separate spreadsheets, text messages from tenants, and handwritten notes.  
As the portfolio grows, the investor notices:
- Net income fluctuates month to month  
- One property seems to “break even” despite strong rent  
- Expense patterns are unclear  
- Long-term ROI is difficult to measure  

They need unified visibility into rental performance and a way to evaluate which properties deserve reinvestment.

The Real Estate Financial Analytics Dashboard is implemented to consolidate all financials and generate KPI-driven insights.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Consolidation & KPI Extraction
The investor’s historical rent payments, expenses, and mortgage details are loaded into the model.

**Key KPIs generated:**
- Net Operating Income (NOI)  
- Cash Flow After Debt Service  
- Expense Ratio  
- ROI & Cash-on-Cash Return  
- Annualized rent growth  
- Maintenance cost trends  

This immediately exposes inconsistencies between properties.

### ✅ Step 2 — Performance Diagnosis
With KPIs centralized, several issues emerge:

1. **Property 2** shows an expense ratio of **58%**, far above the portfolio average.  
2. **Property 4** delivers strong NOI but low cash flow due to a high-interest mortgage.  
3. Seasonal spending spikes (repairs + utilities) were hidden in the original spreadsheets.  
4. Rent growth across the portfolio averaged **3.2%**, except for Property 1, which remained flat for 18 months.

The dashboard Pinpoints the exact sources of profit leakage.

### ✅ Step 3 — Financial Modeling & Scenario Analysis
The investor tests several scenarios:

**Scenario A — Refinance Property 4**  
- New mortgage drops monthly debt service by 18%  
- Cash flow increases by ~$240/month  

**Scenario B — Adjust rent for Property 1**  
- Implementing a small rent increase of $75 raises annual ROI by 1.1%  

**Scenario C — Reduce maintenance costs for Property 2**  
- Outsourcing recurring repairs cuts yearly expenses by 22%  

Each scenario recalculates KPIs and updates the forecast visuals.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Final Recommendations
Based on the analytics:

- **Refinance Property 4** to unlock hidden cash flow  
- **Increase rent on Property 1** to match market levels  
- **Address maintenance inefficiencies** on Property 2  
- Allocate future capital toward units with the highest ROI trend  
- Use dashboard monthly to track rent, expenses, and cash flow consistency  

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Outcome
Within one quarter of implementing dashboard-driven strategies:

- Portfolio cash flow improved by **15–18%**  
- Underperforming property ROI increased after expense optimization  
- Investor reduced manual reporting time by **25%**  
- Decision-making became proactive instead of reactive  
- Clear, centralized KPIs replaced five separate spreadsheets  

The investor now relies on the dashboard as their main financial command center for property performance, forecasting, and strategic planning.
